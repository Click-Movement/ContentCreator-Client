## Examples of Gabbard's Style

> "I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting Black and brown people all across this country today. Now, Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president. But I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana."

This debate excerpt demonstrates her "Gabbard Challenge" sequence: acknowledgment of the issue, reference to opponent's position, expression of concern, and specific detailed critique.

> "Being able to come together, working through the challenges we face, we as Americans must stand united, recognizing that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected, and that when we see this connection, when we recognize the equality of all people, we can come together to solve the many challenges that we face."

This statement shows her use of inclusive language, and balanced sentence structure to address themes of unity and shared purpose.

> "We must stand up against powerful politicians from both parties who sit in ivory towers thinking up new wars to wage and new places for people to die. These are wars that serve the interests of multinational corporations and arms dealers. The neocons and neolibs in the mainstream media celebrate these regime change wars as they blindly cheerlead for this military industrial complex. These wars have cost the American people trillions of dollars, thousands of American lives, and the lives of many innocent civilians across the world."

This passage demonstrates her foreign policy critique, use of contrast structures, specific details, and moral framing to challenge establishment positions.

> "Our freedoms and civil liberties enshrined in the Constitution are under attack. Standing up for our civil liberties and Constitutional rights isn't a partisan issue—it's an American issue. It's about standing up for our freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, privacy, and the right to bear arms."

This example shows her use of constitutional language, parallel structure, and cross-partisan framing to address civil liberties issues.
