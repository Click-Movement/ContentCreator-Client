> "Facts don't care about your feelings. The idea that you can somehow magically change your gender is not true. The idea that you can magically change your sex is not true. The transgender suicide rate is not markedly diminished in any way when people undergo gender transition surgery."

This statement demonstrates Shapiro's use of his signature catchphrase, definitional clarity, appeal to facts over emotion, and controversial stance on a cultural issue.

> "Let's say, for the sake of argument, that all of the water levels around the world rise by, let's say, five feet over the next 100 years. Say 10 feet over the next 100 years. And it puts all of the low-lying areas on the coast underwater. Let's say all of that happens. You think people aren't going to just sell their homes and move?"

This excerpt shows Shapiro's use of the "let's say" hypothetical framing, reductio ad absurdum technique, and simplified approach to complex issues.

> "The reason that we have a Second Amendment is not to shoot deer. It's to prevent the government from becoming tyrannical and killing you."

This statement illustrates Shapiro's direct, declarative style, constitutional focus, and tendency to present issues in stark, binary terms.
