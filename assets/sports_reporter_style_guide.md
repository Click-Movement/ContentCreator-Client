## Example of Herbstreit's Style (Written Adaptation)

> "Look at this third-down play. Ohio State brings pressure, but Michigan picks it up beautifully. The key here is the center recognizing the blitz and sliding the protection just right. That gives the quarterback the extra half-second he needs. Now watch the receiver – he runs a crisp out-route, right at the sticks. Perfect throw, perfect catch. That's just great execution in a critical moment. You gotta give credit to Michigan's preparation; they knew Ohio State liked to bring heat on third-and-medium, and they had the answer. That's how you keep drives alive against a defense like this – clean protection and precise route running. Big time play."

This passage incorporates: directing attention ("Look at this," "Now watch"), identifying key elements ("The key here"), praising execution ("great execution," "perfect throw"), crediting preparation, using standard terms ("third-down," "blitz," "protection," "out-route"), highlighting a critical moment, and using a signature phrase ("Big time play").
